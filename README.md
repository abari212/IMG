The imaging techniques codes
are meant to help with image capture and machine learning (neural networks) based analysis.
The reposiory contains several codes to capture and process image data. 
The results of these codes applied to touhsands of images have been published and communicated in different fora.
These codes have also led to the development of new image descriptros combining fractcal geomtry (Brownian motion) with different neural networks (RBF and GA). 
The approach has been referred in industry (car).
