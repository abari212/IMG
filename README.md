The imaging techniques codes are meant to help with image capture and machine learning (neural networks) based analysis. The repository contains several codes to capture and process image data. The results of these codes applied to thousands of images have been published and communicated in different fora. These codes have also led to the development of new image pertinent descriptors combining fractal geometry (Brownian motion) with different neural networks (RBF and GA). The approach has been referred to in industries (car industry).
