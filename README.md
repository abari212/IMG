The imaging techniques codes, in this repository, are meant to help with image capture and image rapid identification using machine learning (neural networks) techniques. The repository contains several codes to capture, process and analyse image data. 
The results of these codes applied to thousands of images have been published and communicated in different fora. These codes have also led to the development of new image pertinent descriptors combining fractal geometry (Brownian motion) with different neural networks (RBF and GA). 
The approach has been referred to and used in different industries, including car industry.
